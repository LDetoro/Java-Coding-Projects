# Java-Coding-Projects


## Overview
This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms that I worked on during my Data Structures course. The programs cover fundamental operations on arrays, lists, recursion, and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Contents

### Array Utilities
- **ArrayUtils2.java** - Generates an array of random integers within a given range.
- **ArrayUtils3.java** - Returns a reversed copy of an array.
- **ArrayUtils4.java** - Reverses an array in place.
- **CopyHalf.java** - Copies the first half of an array.

### Data Processing
- **Data.java** - Computes the sum of a given row in a 2D array.
- **Numbers.java** - Swaps the first and last elements of an array.
- **RemoveTester.java** - Removes all odd elements from a partially filled array.
- **Tables.java** - Calculates the average of the corner values in a 2D array.
- **zeroesDist.java** - Computes the distance between the first and last occurrences of zero in an array.

### Banking System
- **BankAccount.java** - A basic bank account class with deposit and withdrawal functionality.
- **CheckingAccount.java** - A checking account implementation with overdraft protection.
- **CreditCardAccount.java** - A credit card account with balance tracking.
- **SavingsAccount.java** - A savings account implementation.
- **TestAccount.java** - A test class for validating account functionality.

### Object-Oriented Programs
- **Box.java** - Represents a simple box with dimensions.
- **Converter.java** - Utility for converting between different units.
- **Initials.java** - Extracts initials from a given name.
- **PatternMatcher.java** - Matches and processes specific patterns in strings.

### Miscellaneous Programs
- **AllDuplicates.java** - Identifies duplicate elements in an array.
- **AllLessThanAverage.java** - Finds elements smaller than the average in an array.
- **AverageAndSum.java** - Computes the average and sum of an array.
- **EvenAndOdd.java** - Separates even and odd numbers.
- **GetInRange.java** - Filters numbers within a specified range.
- **MinAndMax.java** - Finds the minimum and maximum in an array.
- **Range.java** - Generates a list of numbers within a given range.
